PUNCH-IT!!

To start, press the green or  blue buttons as the lights flash by.

The lights in the middle will count down, time it right and make your move!

BLUE: Left Punch: This will deal 25 damage to the opponent, provided it doesn’t dodge.

GREEN: Right Punch: This will deal 25 damage to the opponent, provided it doesn’t dodge

Back on the joystick: Guard, this will reduce the damage your opponent deals if it chooses to punch to 10

Right on the joystick: Right dodge, if your opponent chooses Right Punch, it will take 25 damage instead.

Left on the joystick: Left dodge, similar to Right Dodge, if your opponent picks Left Punch, it will take  25 damage instead of you.

Do nothing: if you let your guard down your opponent will capitalize on this and you’ll take 30 damage.

As you take damage your white lights will dim, as you deal damage your opponent’s red lights will dim. The first to dim the other’s lights wins!
